Elliptic Integrals
------------------

Igor Moiseev has a collection of Matlab code for calculating
elliptic integrals and assorted special functions.
The official code repository is on Google Code: <http://code.google.com/p/elliptic/>

We will be extending the functions `elliptic12` and `elliptic3` to accept
greater ranges of parameter input as well as computing the complete elliptic
integrals for these greater ranges.

Files:

* `elliptic12.m`
* `elliptic3.m`
* `elliptic_tests.m`

Magnet code
-----------

We will be implementing extensions to the Matlab code for calculating forces,
etc., between magnets that is located on GitHub: <http://github.com/wspr/magcode>

Files:

* `Torque.m` â€” Calculating the torque between two parallel cuboid magnets.
